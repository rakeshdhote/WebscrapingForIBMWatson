# Web Scraping Script for the IBM Watson  

The repo consists of the Python web scraping script to extract 126 parks information from the [OntarioParks.com](OntarioParks.com) website. 

The script writes parks information in the `Microsoft Word` formatted document. This document serves an input to train the `IBM Watson` for predicting the appropriate park based on the asked question.

The script uses the following Python packages:
*  BeautifulSoup  
*  Requests  
*  docx.

The project is for educational purpose and not intended to use for any commercial applications.
